## ÔøΩüéØ **Prompt Engineering Documentation**

This section documents the sophisticated prompt engineering techniques used to create an effective AI customer support agent.

### üìù **Core System Prompt**

The main system prompt establishes the AI's role, personality, and behavior guidelines:

```text
You are a helpful and professional customer support assistant for our company. 
Your goal is to provide accurate, helpful, and friendly responses to customer inquiries.

Guidelines for responses:
- Be polite, professional, and empathetic
- Provide clear and concise answers
- If you don't know something, admit it and offer to escalate
- Use **bold formatting** for important information like policies or numbers
- Always end with asking if there's anything else you can help with
- For refund/return questions, mention our 30-day policy
- For technical issues, suggest basic troubleshooting first
- For account issues, recommend contacting support for security

Context: You work for a general e-commerce/service company that helps customers with:
- Account management and login issues  
- Order tracking and delivery questions
- Refund and return policies
- Technical support for apps/websites
- Billing and payment inquiries
- General product information

Remember: You're representing our company, so maintain a professional and helpful tone at all times.
```

### üîÑ **Dynamic Context Integration**

The system dynamically enhances prompts with:

1. **Conversation History Context**
```python
# Recent conversation context is added to maintain coherence
context_prompt = f"Previous conversation context:\n{conversation_history}\n\nUser's current question: {user_message}"
```

2. **FAQ Knowledge Base Integration**
```python
# Relevant FAQs are automatically included when keywords match
if relevant_faqs:
    enhanced_prompt = f"{system_prompt}\n\nRelevant FAQ information:\n{faq_context}\n\nUser question: {user_message}"
```

3. **Confidence-Based Response Modulation**
```python
# System adjusts response style based on confidence in the answer
if confidence_score < 0.7:
    prompt += "\nNote: If you're not confident about this answer, suggest escalating to a human agent."
```

### üé® **Prompt Engineering Strategies**

#### **1. Role-Based Prompting**
- **Clear Identity**: Establishes the AI as a "customer support assistant"
- **Company Representation**: Emphasizes professional representation
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines what the AI can help with

#### **2. Behavioral Guidelines**
- **Tone Instructions**: "Be polite, professional, and empathetic"
- **Response Format**: Specific formatting instructions (bold text, structure)
- **Escalation Protocol**: Clear guidelines on when to escalate

#### **3. Context-Aware Prompting**
- **Domain Knowledge**: E-commerce/service company context
- **FAQ Integration**: Automatic inclusion of relevant knowledge base entries
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple exchanges

#### **4. Conditional Prompt Enhancement**
```python
# Example: Enhanced prompting based on query type
if "refund" in user_message.lower():
    prompt += "\nImportant: Always mention our 30-day money-back guarantee policy."
    
if "technical" in user_message.lower():
    prompt += "\nStart with basic troubleshooting before escalating to technical support."
```

### üîß **Advanced Prompt Techniques**

#### **1. Few-Shot Learning Examples**
```python
examples = """
Example interactions:
User: "I can't log into my account"
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you with your login issue. Let's try a few troubleshooting steps:
1. **Reset your password** using the "Forgot Password" link
2. **Clear your browser cache** and try again
3. **Check if Caps Lock is on**

If these don't work, I can escalate this to our technical team. Would you like me to do that?

User: "What's your refund policy?"
Assistant: I'd be happy to explain our refund policy:

We offer a **30-day money-back guarantee** on all purchases. Here's how it works:
- **Full refunds** within 30 days of purchase
- Items must be in **original condition**
- **Digital products** may have different terms

Would you like help processing a refund for a specific order?
```

#### **2. Confidence-Based Prompting**
```python
def enhance_prompt_by_confidence(base_prompt, confidence_score):
    if confidence_score < 0.5:
        return base_prompt + "\nIMPORTANT: You seem uncertain about this query. Acknowledge your uncertainty and offer to connect the user with a human agent immediately."
    elif confidence_score < 0.7:
        return base_prompt + "\nNote: If you're not completely confident in your answer, mention that a human agent can provide more detailed assistance."
    else:
        return base_prompt + "\nYou can answer this confidently, but still offer additional help if needed."
```

#### **3. Escalation Trigger Prompts**
```python
escalation_indicators = [
    "complex technical issue",
    "billing dispute", 
    "account security concern",
    "legal question",
    "complaint about service"
]

if any(indicator in user_message.lower() for indicator in escalation_indicators):
    prompt += "\nThis appears to be a complex issue that may require human assistance. Be helpful with initial guidance but suggest speaking with a specialist."
```

### üè∑Ô∏è **Prompt Categories & Examples**

#### **1. Greeting & Welcome Prompts**
```text
Initial Greeting: "Hello there! Thanks for reaching out. How can I assist you today?"

Follow-up Engagement: "I'm here to help with any questions about your account, orders, billing, or technical issues. What can I help you with?"
```

#### **2. FAQ-Enhanced Prompts**
When FAQ matches are found, prompts are dynamically enhanced:
```python
# Example: Password reset query triggers FAQ integration
faq_enhanced_prompt = f"""
{base_system_prompt}

Relevant FAQ Information:
- **Password Reset**: Users can reset passwords using the "Forgot Password" link
- **Account Recovery**: For account access issues, verify email and check spam folder
- **Security**: Never ask users for their passwords directly

User Question: {user_message}
"""
```

#### **3. Escalation Decision Prompts**
```python
escalation_prompt = """
Based on the conversation context and query complexity, determine if this should be escalated:

Escalate if:
- Technical issues beyond basic troubleshooting
- Billing disputes or payment problems
- Account security concerns
- Legal or policy questions
- User expresses frustration with previous responses

Escalation Response Format:
"I understand this is a complex issue. Let me connect you with one of our specialists who can provide more detailed assistance. Would you like me to escalate this to our [technical/billing/account] team?"
"""
```

### ÔøΩ **Prompt Performance Metrics**

The system tracks prompt effectiveness through:

- **Confidence Scoring**: Each response includes a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- **Escalation Rate**: Tracks when prompts successfully identify escalation needs
- **FAQ Match Accuracy**: Measures how well prompts utilize knowledge base
- **Response Satisfaction**: Implied through conversation continuation vs escalation

### üß† **Prompt Engineering Principles Applied**

#### **1. Clarity & Specificity**
```text
‚ùå Vague: "Help the user"
‚úÖ Specific: "Provide step-by-step troubleshooting for login issues, starting with password reset"
```

#### **2. Context Preservation**
```python
# Each prompt includes relevant conversation history
prompt_with_context = f"""
{system_prompt}

Conversation History:
{previous_messages}

Current User Message: {current_message}

Remember: Maintain consistency with previous responses and build upon the established conversation context.
"""
```

#### **3. Controlled Creativity**
```text
Guidelines for response generation:
- Stay within customer support domain
- Use company-appropriate language
- Provide factual information only
- When uncertain, acknowledge limitations
```

### üí° **Innovative Prompt Features**

#### **1. Dynamic Personality Adjustment**
```python
# Adjusts tone based on user sentiment and conversation history
if user_sentiment == "frustrated":
    prompt += "\nNote: The user seems frustrated. Use extra empathy and offer immediate escalation options."
elif user_sentiment == "neutral":
    prompt += "\nMaintain a professional, helpful tone."
```

#### **2. Multi-Turn Conversation Optimization**
```python
# Optimizes prompts for conversation flow
if conversation_turns > 3 and not resolved:
    prompt += "\nThis conversation is getting lengthy. Summarize progress and offer escalation if issue isn't resolved soon."
```

#### **3. Response Format Control**
```text
Response Formatting Instructions:
- Use **bold** for important information (policies, numbers, steps)
- Structure responses with clear bullet points or numbered lists
- Always end with a helpful follow-up question
- Keep responses conversational but professional
```

## ÔøΩ **Prompt Implementation Code**

### Core Prompt Processing Function
```python
async def generate_response(self, message: str, conversation_history: List[dict]) -> dict:
    """
    Main prompt processing function that demonstrates advanced prompt engineering
    """
    try:

        final_prompt = self._apply_confidence_modulation(enhanced_prompt, message)
        
        # 5. Generate response with engineered prompt
        response = await self._call_ai_with_prompt(final_prompt, message, context_prompt)
        
        return {
            "response": response.content,
            "confidence": self._calculate_confidence_score(response),
            "prompt_used": final_prompt[:200] + "..." # For debugging
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return self._handle_prompt_error(e)

def _build_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    """Constructs the foundational system prompt"""
    return """

        return base_prompt
    
    faq_context = "\n\nRelevant FAQ Information:\n"
    for faq in faq_matches:
        faq_context += f"- **{faq['question']}**: {faq['answer']}\n"
    
    enhanced_prompt = f"""
    {base_prompt}
    {faq_context}
    
    Instructions: Use the FAQ information above to provide accurate, consistent responses. 
    If the user's question relates to any FAQ topics, incorporate that information naturally 
    into your response while maintaining a conversational tone.
    """
    
    return enhanced_prompt
